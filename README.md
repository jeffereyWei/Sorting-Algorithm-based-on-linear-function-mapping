# Sorting-Algorithm-based-on-linear-function-mapping
improved sorting algorithm based on linear function mapping.
This file introduce a new sorting algorithm different with other previous algorithm. This algo use a mapping idea to accomplish queue work but not directly to queue the data set. This algo will descrease algo cost sharply in special conditions. And I think other similar type algo will be optimized using the same ideas. If they done, the computer science will be influenced heavily.
